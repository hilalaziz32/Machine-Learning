        "# Online Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Online machine learning is a real-time approach where models learn from incoming data, updating as it arrives. üîÑ Unlike batch learning, it adapts dynamically to changing data streams. It's great for rapid processing, like in streaming analytics üìà or recommendation systems. This method efficiently handles large data volumes, but also faces challenges like concept drift üåä and choosing optimal learning rates. Overall, online ML is a powerful tool for building adaptive models from continuous data streams.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples include real-time stock market prediction üìà, dynamic pricing in e-commerce üí∞, personalized news recommendations üì∞, and fraud detection in financial transactions üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Online ML is vital for scenarios where data is generated rapidly and needs immediate processing for decision-making."

        "Definition: Online machine learning is a way for models to learn from data as it arrives, continuously updating themselves instead of being trained on a static dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Point: It's like learning on the go, adapting quickly to new information.\n",

        "Usage Scenarios:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-time Data: When data is constantly streaming, like live sensor data or social media feeds.\n",
        "Changing Data Patterns: When the data changes over time, like stock prices or user behavior.\n",
        "Limited Storage: When you can‚Äôt store large amounts of data and need to process it immediately.\n",
